# Aggregate and Merge Data in Pandas while Analyzing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces

I analyze a dataset about LEGO, which will help answering the following questions:
  1. What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
  2. In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
  3. Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?
  4. When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?
  5. Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

What I can do:
  1. Combine a Notebook with HTML Markup.
  2. Apply Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames.
  3. Aggregate data using the .agg() function.
  4. Create scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib.
  5. Understand database schemas that are organised by primary and foreign keys.
  6. Merge DataFrames that share a common key
